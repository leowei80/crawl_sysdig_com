        <p>Securing the Cloud with End‑to‑End Detection</p>&#13;
        <p>Traditional security measures struggle to effectively protect the dynamic and distributed nature of modern applications. Threats can now exploit vulnerabilities across various layers of cloud infrastructure, making it crucial to adopt a unified approach to security and threat detection.</p>&#13;

<h2>Detect and Respond to Attacks at Cloud Speed</h2>
<div>
<p>Adopt a unified, proactive approach to defending against evolving cloud threats through a consolidated cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) with Sysdig.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Real-Time Detection</p>
<div><p>Stop attacks up to 10 times faster.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>End-to-End Coverage</p>
<div><p>Consolidate security across containers, cloud services, Linux/Windows servers, identities, and third-party apps.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attack Path Visualization</p>
<div><p>Layer real-time detections on attack path analysis to reveal active lateral movement and visualize the attack’s reach.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<span>In the cloud, everything happens fast. Time is of the essence when stopping attacks. Breaches can be very costly. Sysdig enables us to quickly detect and respond to cloud attacks at cloud speed by knowing what is happening, the exact container or location in the cloud, and what is causing it, versus hours to detect and understand what needs to be done.”
