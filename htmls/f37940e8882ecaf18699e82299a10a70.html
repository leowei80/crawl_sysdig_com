<span>If my team logs in and sees 500 vulnerabilities, they then think, ‘Am I going to fix our vulnerability, or am I going to spend my time developing something that creates some money?’ Sysdig shows us what is important and how to fix it, which is key to reducing our risk, so we don’t waste our time.”
