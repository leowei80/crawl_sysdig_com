<p>As more and more workloads move to the cloud, the attack surface security teams need to secure has grown exponentially. To guard the massive perimeter of the cloud, you need to position your cloud infrastructure to be as safe as possible by default.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to decide which vendor is the right fit for your organization, we feel that Gartner® Peer Insights™ is always a great place to start because it’s a synthesis of reviews and ratings from organizations actually using the solutions. They’ve just released their latest Voice of the Customer for Cloud Security Posture Management Tools, and it’s well worth a look.</p>
<p>Sysdig was recognized as one of only two Strong Performers in this CSPM report, and received the highest overall rating of 5 out of 5 based on 30 reviews as of 31 November 2023. Bear in mind — this recognition directly represents the value our customers gain from using our platform.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-our-customers-rate-us">How our customers rate us</h2>
<p>What does it mean for us to receive the highest overall rating in a report like the Voice of the Customer? In Sysdig’s case, it means we received an overall rating from our customers of 5 out of 5, based on 30 reviews as of 31 November 2023. In fact, Sysdig was the <strong>only vendor</strong> in the report to get the maximum 5 stars. Our ratings by category were also the highest of any vendor: a 4.9 out of 5 for product capabilities, sales experience, and deployment experience, and 5 out of 5 for support experience. And we were recommended by a whopping<strong> 97% of our customers</strong>.</p>
<figure><span/></figure>
<br/>
<p>Sysdig was placed in the <strong>Strong Performer</strong> quadrant. Vendors placed in the upper-left “Strong Performer” quadrant of the “Voice of the Customer” graphic meet or exceed the market average for Overall Experience but do not meet the market average for User Interest and Adoption.</p>

<h2 id="h-sysdig-s-secret-sauce-addressing-active-cloud-risk-nbsp">Sysdig’s secret sauce: Addressing active cloud risk </h2>
<p>It’s clear that Sysdig’s approach to CSPM is resonating with our customers. But what, exactly, sets our CSPM apart?</p>
<p>Sysdig uses runtime insights to uncover and prioritize active cloud risk and go beyond static risk analysis provided by traditional CSPM solutions. The importance of runtime insights for CSPM is evident in the feedback we received from customers, like in this review: </p>
<br/>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m genuinely impressed with the level of real-time security posture checks it brings to our cloud infrastructure. The solution has proven to be an invaluable asset in ensuring the safety of our cloud-native application and data.</em></p>
<cite><span>Gartner Review</span></cite></blockquote>
<br/>
<p>Sysdig’s CSPM is also part of a larger CNAPP solution, combining cloud workload protection, cloud infrastructure entitlement management, and detection and response into a single security platform that provides our customers with end-to-end coverage from prevention to defense. In another review, a customer writes: </p>
<br/>
<blockquote>
<p><em>My overall experience with Sysdig CNAPP has been overwhelmingly positive. Its comprehensive cloud-native security features, including vulnerability management, offer not detection capabilities but robust protection for our cloud-native services and applications. With Sysdig CNAPP in place, [I] feel more confident in our cloud infrastructure’s security and safety of our critical data.</em></p>
<cite><span>Gartner Review</span></cite></blockquote>
<br/>
<p>This consolidated approach to cloud security, plus our unique runtime insights-based approach to combat active cloud risk, are what make Sysdig stand out.  But if you’d rather hear what makes us different from our customers, here’s just a few more of the reviews we’ve received on Gartner Peer Insights:</p>
<br/>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sysdig CSPM provides unmatched insight and fortified security for cloud-native infrastructure with state-of-art technology. Powered by Falco, it offers comprehensive visibility, empowering businesses to monitor and safeguard cloud assets efficiently. From identifying vulnerabilities and misconfiguration to proactive threat detection and compliance, Sysdig CSPM is an indispensable platform for strengthening cloud security. Embrace it for unparalleled protection and confidence in the ever-evolving cloud computing landscape.</em></p>
<cite><span>Gartner Review</span></cite></blockquote>
<br/>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Since implementing Sysdig CSPM, our incident response time has drastically improved, allowing us to mitigate security issues promptly.</em></p>
<cite><span>Gartner Review</span></cite></blockquote>
<br/>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sysdig CSPM is outstanding for our multi-cloud environment. It strengthens operational efficiency and risk control through monitoring and strong security. Real-time insights aid troubleshooting and integration is seamless.</em></p>
